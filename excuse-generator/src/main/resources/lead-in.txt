I'm sorry but
Please forgive me
Beg you a thousand pardons
I apologize, however
I'm never usually like this
You're never going to believe this
Guess what happened?!?!
Holy shit! Get this
Boy do I have a story for you
So I was minding my own business and boom!
The most unbelievable thing just happened
I couldn't be more apologetic but
Sorry I'm late
I couldn't go because
I couldn't help it
This is terrible excuse but
This is going to sound crazy but
Holy moses!
Blimey! Sorry I'm late guv'nha
My bad
I swear it wasn't my fault
I lost track of time because
I feel terrible, but
Don't blame me
